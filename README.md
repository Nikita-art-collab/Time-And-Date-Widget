# Time and Date Widget

## Overview

This project is a simple, customizable digital clock and date widget built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time (hours, minutes, and seconds) and the current date (weekday, day, and month) in real-time. The clock updates every second.

## Features

- Displays current time (hours, minutes, seconds).
- Displays the current weekday, day, and month.
- Real-time updates using JavaScript.
- Fully customizable design with CSS.
- Responsive and clean UI with a neon-like glow effect.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the widget.
- **CSS**: Styling, layout, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic time and date updates.

## Files

- `index.html`: Contains the basic structure of the widget.
- `style.css`: Styles the widget, including the neon glow effect and the layout.
- `script.js`: Provides the logic for updating the clock and date every second.

## Customization

- You can easily change the font, colors, and layout by editing the `style.css` file.
- The format of the time (12-hour or 24-hour format) and other customization options can be modified in the `script.js` file.

## Known Issues

- The alignment of the digits (hours, minutes, seconds) might need manual adjustment depending on font size and screen width. This can be tweaked by modifying the CSS, especially the `span` elements in the `.clock-container`.
